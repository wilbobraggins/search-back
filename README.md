# Rails Datascraper Serving a Vue frontend.

Rails backend for storing data, dealing with authentication, and serving logic for web-scraping.

Used:

• Rails 5.2.3

• Ruby  2.6.0

• Gem jwt-sessions

• Gem rack-cors

• Gem redis

The idea with the backend was to create a CRUD app to handle authentication tokens and scrape data from 'stackoverflow.com' all while rendering to a seperate Vue.js app.
